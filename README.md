#### "Why not use another library"

For the love of all that is holy, **PLEASE USE ANOTHER LIBRARY!**

This is my attempt at learning elliptical orbital mechanics. This is likely not a good library to use, especially if you value accuracy. I am brand-new to this area of physics/mechanics.

#### Usage

> "Why would you use this?"

\- Every logical person ever

Note: Uses Java 11+ though there is no reason for a Java version that high. I want to get "ahead of the curve", as it were; it's generally not a good idea to update _just to update_, but Java 11 is the next long-term-support Java release, and I think it's a good idea to support it earlier than later as its new features (like modules from Java 9) could be potentially useful in the future.
